# iOS App Store Optimization

## App Name (30 characters)

**Strategy**:
- Brand name + primary keyword
- Most important ranking factor
- Visible in search results

**Format**:
```
[Brand Name] - [Primary Keyword]
[Brand Name]: [Benefit Statement]
```

**Examples**:
```
Good: "Headspace: Sleep & Meditation"
Good: "Calm - Meditate, Sleep, Relax"
Bad:  "The Best Sleep and Meditation App for Relaxation" (too long)
```

**Rules**:
- Use full 30 characters
- Include top keyword
- Keep brand recognizable
- No keyword stuffing
- No generic terms alone

## Subtitle (30 characters)

**Strategy**:
- Secondary keywords
- Explain app function
- Differentiator or benefit

**Format**:
```
[Secondary Keyword] + [Benefit/Feature]
```

**Examples**:
```
Good: "Daily Mindfulness & Sleep"
Good: "Focus Timer & Habit Tracker"
Bad:  "The Best App Ever Made" (no keywords)
```

## Keyword Field (100 characters)

**Strategy**:
- Hidden from users
- Comma-separated (no spaces after commas)
- No duplicates (already in name/subtitle)
- Include misspellings and variants
- Use singular forms (Apple finds plurals)

**Format**:
```
keyword1,keyword2,keyword3,keyword4,misspelling,variant
```

**Research Process**:
1. Brainstorm seed keywords
2. Analyze competitor keywords (tools: AppTweak, Sensor Tower)
3. Check search volume estimates
4. Assess difficulty/competition
5. Select mix of high-volume and long-tail

**Prioritization**:
| Priority | Keyword Type | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | High volume, medium competition | "meditation" |
| 2 | Medium volume, low competition | "sleep sounds" |
| 3 | Long-tail specific | "anxiety relief app" |
| 4 | Misspellings | "mediation" |

## Full Description (4,000 characters)

**Note**: iOS description is NOT indexed for search. Focus on conversion.

**Structure**:
```
[Hook - compelling first line visible before "more"]

[Core Benefits - bullet points or short paragraphs]
• Benefit 1
• Benefit 2
• Benefit 3

[Social Proof]
"Featured by Apple" / "10 million downloads"

[Key Features]
Feature 1: Description
Feature 2: Description

[Subscription Details - if applicable]
Pricing, trial information

[Call to Action]
Download now and start [benefit]

[Legal/Contact]
Terms, privacy, support contact
```

## Promotional Text (170 characters)

**Strategy**:
- Can be updated without review
- Use for timely promotions
- Seasonal messaging
- Feature announcements

**Examples**:
```
"New: Sleep Stories narrated by celebrities. Try our 7-day free trial!"
"Holiday Special: 50% off annual subscription. Limited time offer."
```

### iOS Screenshot Sizes

| iPhone 5.5" | 1242 x 2208 |

### Screenshot Strategy

**Order of Screenshots**:
1. Hero shot with main value proposition
2. Key feature 1
3. Key feature 2

6. Differentiator
7-10. Additional features

**Design Best Practices**:
- Clear headline text (large, readable)
- Actual app UI shown

- Highlight key actions/features
- Use captions that explain benefits

**Caption Formula**:
```
[Benefit/Outcome] + [Feature that delivers it]

Examples:
"Fall Asleep Faster with Guided Sleep Stories"
"Track Your Progress with Beautiful Statistics"
"Stay Focused with Customizable Timers"
```

## App Preview Videos (Up to 3, 30s each)

**Structure**:
```
0-5s:  Hook - show main benefit
5-15s: Key feature 1 demo
15-25s: Key feature 2 demo
25-30s: Call to action + app icon
```

**Rules**:
- No external footage (only app capture)
- Can include device frame
- Text overlays allowed
- Music/voiceover allowed
- Must reflect actual app experience

# Google Play Store Optimization

## App Title (30 characters)

Same strategy as iOS, but more weight given to keywords.

**Format**:
```

[Brand Name] - [Keyword Phrase]
```

## Short Description (80 characters)

**Strategy**:
- Indexed for search (important for rankings)
- Visible in search results

- Compelling benefit statement

**Formula**:
```
[Action verb] + [benefit] + [keyword] + [differentiator]
```

Good: "Learn languages fast with AI. Spanish, French, German & more."
Bad:  "Download our amazing app today!" (no keywords)
```

## Full Description (4,000 characters)

**Important**: Unlike iOS, Play Store description IS indexed for search.

### Keyword Strategy
