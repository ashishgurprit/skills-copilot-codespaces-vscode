## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword stuffing** - Unnatural repetition hurts more than helps
2. **Generic screenshots** - First impression matters enormously
3. **Ignoring reviews** - Respond quickly, especially to negatives
4. **Wrong category** - Can tank discoverability
5. **No localization plan** - Missing huge markets
6. **Forgetting iPad** - Significant user base
7. **Poor first screenshot** - Most users only see this one
8. **No promotional plan** - ASO alone isn't enough
9. **Launching on Friday** - Support harder over weekend
10. **Skipping soft launch** - Miss chance to optimize before wide release
