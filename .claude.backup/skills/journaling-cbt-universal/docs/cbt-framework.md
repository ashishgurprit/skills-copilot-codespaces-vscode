# CBT Framework & Methodology

**Traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy concepts for clinical journaling applications**

---

## Overview

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.

**Core Principle:** Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. By changing thoughts and behaviors, we can improve emotional well-being.

## 1. The Cognitive Model

```
Situation (Trigger)
      ↓
Automatic Thought
      ↓
┌─────┴─────┐
↓           ↓
Emotion    Behavior
↓           ↓
└─────┬─────┘
      ↓
Physical Sensations
```

**Example:**
- **Situation:** Friend doesn't respond to text
- **Automatic Thought:** "They're mad at me"
- **Emotion:** Anxiety (80/100)
- **Behavior:** Send multiple follow-up texts
- **Physical:** Tightness in chest, restlessness

---

## 2. Thought Record (7-Column Format)

The foundational CBT tool for examining and challenging thoughts.

### Columns

| # | Column | Purpose | Example |
|---|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Situation** | What happened? | "Presentation at work meeting" |
| 2 | **Automatic Thoughts** | What went through your mind? | "I'll mess up and look incompetent" |
| 3 | **Emotions** | What did you feel? (0-100) | Anxiety (85), Fear (70) |
| 4 | **Physical Sensations** | Body reactions | Heart racing, sweaty palms |
| 5 | **Evidence For** | What supports the thought? | "I stumbled on words once before" |
| 6 | **Evidence Against** | What contradicts it? | "Prepared thoroughly, past presentations went well, team is supportive" |
| 7 | **Balanced Thought** | More realistic perspective | "I'm well-prepared. Even if I make a small mistake, it won't define my competence" |

### Post-Balancing

- **Emotions Re-rated:** Anxiety (40), Fear (25)
- **Planned Behavior:** Take deep breaths, focus on content not perfection

---

## 3. Common Cognitive Distortions

**Definition:** Irrational or exaggerated thought patterns that maintain negative thinking.

### The 10 Most Common Distortions

| Distortion | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **All-or-Nothing Thinking** | Seeing things in black-and-white categories | "If I'm not perfect, I'm a total failure" |
| **Overgeneralization** | Single event = never-ending pattern | "I failed this test. I always fail everything" |
| **Mental Filter** | Focus only on negatives, ignore positives | Remembering only the one criticism in a positive review |
| **Disqualifying the Positive** | Positive experiences "don't count" | "They're just being nice, they don't mean it" |
| **Jumping to Conclusions** | Assuming without evidence | |
| - *Mind Reading* | Assuming you know what others think | "They think I'm boring" |
| - *Fortune Telling* | Predicting negative outcomes | "I know I'll fail the interview" |
| **Magnification/Minimization** | Exaggerating negatives, shrinking positives | Catastrophizing a small mistake |
| **Emotional Reasoning** | "I feel it, therefore it's true" | "I feel anxious, so there must be danger" |
| **Should Statements** | Rigid rules causing guilt/frustration | "I should be able to handle this" |
| **Labeling** | Extreme overgeneralization | "I'm a loser" instead of "I made a mistake" |
| **Personalization** | Blaming yourself for external events | "It's my fault the team lost" |

### Implementation

Prompt users to identify which distortions might be present in their automatic thoughts.

```

### Physical Sensations Checklist

---

## 5. Behavioral Activation

**Principle:** Depression and anxiety decrease when we engage in valued activities.

### Activity Types

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Pleasure** | Enjoyment, self-care | Reading, music, nature walk |
| **Mastery** | Accomplishment, competence | Completing a task, learning skill |
| **Social** | Connection, support | Coffee with friend, group activity |
| **Physical** | Movement, energy | Exercise, yoga, stretching |
| **Values-Based** | Meaningful, purposeful | Volunteering, creative project |

### Activity Monitoring Format

| Date/Time | Activity | Type | Mood Before (0-100) | Mood After (0-100) | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|---------------------|--------------------| ------|
| Mon 9am | Morning walk | Physical | Sad: 60 | Sad: 40 | Fresh air helped |
| Mon 2pm | Called friend | Social | Lonely: 70 | Lonely: 30 | Felt connected |

### Activity Scheduling

Users plan activities in advance:
- **What:** Specific activity
- **When:** Day and time
- **With whom:** Alone or social
- **Obstacles:** Potential barriers
- **Solutions:** How to overcome barriers

---

## 6. Core Beliefs Work

**Definition:** Deep-seated beliefs about self, others, and the world formed early in life.

### Types of Core Beliefs

**Negative Core Beliefs (Common):**
- **About Self:** "I'm unlovable," "I'm incompetent," "I'm defective"
- **About Others:** "People are untrustworthy," "Others will reject me"
- **About World:** "The world is dangerous," "Life is unfair"

**Positive Core Beliefs (Goals):**
- "I am worthy of love"
- "I am capable"
- "I can handle challenges"

### Downward Arrow Technique

Ask "What does that mean about me?" repeatedly to uncover core belief:

```
Thought: "I shouldn't have made that mistake at work"
  ↓ What does that mean about you?
"It means I'm not good at my job"
  ↓ What does that mean about you?
"It means I'm not capable"
  ↓ What does that mean about you?
CORE BELIEF: "I'm inadequate"
```

## 7. Exposure Hierarchy (For Anxiety)

**Principle:** Gradual exposure to feared situations reduces anxiety over time.

### Hierarchy Format

| Step | Situation | Anxiety Rating (0-100) | Status |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Think about making phone call | 20 | ✓ Completed |
| 2 | Write script for call | 30 | ✓ Completed |
| 3 | Call to schedule appointment | 50 | In Progress |
| 4 | Call to ask question | 60 | Not Started |
| 5 | Make social phone call | 75 | Not Started |

### Exposure Tracking

After each exposure:
- **Peak Anxiety:** Highest during exposure
- **Ending Anxiety:** Final level
- **Learning:** What did you discover?

---

## 8. Safety Behaviors

**Definition:** Actions taken to prevent feared outcomes that actually maintain anxiety.

### Examples

| Fear | Safety Behavior | Why It's Problematic |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Social judgment | Avoid eye contact | Prevents learning people are friendly |
| Panic attack | Always carry medication | Prevents learning you can cope without it |
| Rejection | Never share opinions | Prevents authentic connection |

### Tracking

- **Situation:** When do you use safety behaviors?
- **Behavior:** What do you do?
- **Short-term effect:** Does it reduce anxiety?
- **Long-term effect:** Does it maintain the problem?

---

## 9. Values Clarification

**Why:** Therapy homework is more effective when aligned with personal values.

### Value Domains

1. **Relationships** - Family, friends, romantic
2. **Work/Education** - Career, learning, achievement
3. **Health** - Physical, mental wellness
4. **Leisure** - Hobbies, fun, recreation
5. **Spirituality** - Meaning, purpose, faith
6. **Citizenship** - Community, environment, social causes
7. **Personal Growth** - Character, skills, self-improvement

### Values Exercise

For each domain:
- **Importance:** 0-10 scale
- **Current Satisfaction:** 0-10 scale
- **Gap:** Identify areas needing attention

---

## 10. Relapse Prevention

### Warning Signs Tracking

Users identify personal early warning signs:
- Mood changes
- Behavior changes (isolation, sleep issues)
- Thought patterns returning
- Physical symptoms

### Coping Strategies Inventory

- **What has worked before?**
- **Who can I reach out to?**
- **What activities help?**
- **What thoughts challenge the spiral?**

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Thought Records** should be the primary feature
2. **Mood tracking** should show trends over time (graphs)
3. **Cognitive distortions** can be suggested by keyword matching
4. **Activity scheduling** should integrate with calendar
5. **Progress notes** should be shareable with therapist (with consent)

### For Clinicians

- This module supports CBT therapy but doesn't replace therapist guidance
- Encourage regular journaling between sessions
- Review entries during sessions to identify patterns
- Customize homework assignments to patient needs
