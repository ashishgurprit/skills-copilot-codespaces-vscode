# THE LINKEDIN ALGORITHM (2025)

## How LinkedIn Ranks Content

```
Post Published
     │
     ├─► Initial Quality Check (AI/Spam filter)
     │
     ├─► Test Audience (~100-500 connections)
     │   └─► Measures: Dwell time, reactions, comments, shares
     │
     ├─► If engagement good → Expand reach
     │   └─► 2nd/3rd degree connections
     │   └─► Topic followers
     │   └─► "Interested in" signals
     │
     └─► If engagement poor → Stop distribution
```

## Algorithm Ranking Factors (Priority Order)

| Factor | Weight | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Dwell Time** | Critical | Time spent reading your post |
| **Comments** | Very High | Especially meaningful comments (not "Great post!") |
| **Saves** | Very High | Indicates high-value content |
| **Shares** | High | With commentary > without |
| **Reactions** | Medium | Any reaction helps |
| **Profile views** | Medium | Did they check your profile after? |
| **Follows** | High | New followers from post |

## What Kills Reach

| Killer | Impact | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| External links in post | -50% reach | LinkedIn wants users to stay |
| Editing within 10 min | -30% reach | Resets algorithm |
| Engagement pods | Shadowban risk | Detected and penalized |
| "Link in comments" | Reduced | LinkedIn caught on |
| Tag spam | Reduced | Tagging non-engagers |
| Hashtag spam | Reduced | More than 3-5 hashtags |
| Posting frequency | Reduced | More than 1-2/day |

# THE ANATOMY OF A VIRAL POST

## The Hook (First 2-3 Lines)

**Critical**: LinkedIn shows ~210 characters before "...see more"
Users decide in 1-3 seconds whether to expand.

### Hook Formulas That Work

**1. The Bold Statement**
```
[Controversial opinion that challenges conventional wisdom]

I said what I said.
```
Example:
```
Hustle culture is a scam.

Working 80 hours a week doesn't make you successful.
It makes you exhausted.
```

**2. The Pattern Interrupt**
```
[Unexpected statement that stops the scroll]
```
Example:
```
I got fired today.

Best thing that ever happened to me.
```

**3. The "I" Statement**
```
I [did something unexpected/vulnerable/impressive]

Here's what happened:
```
Example:
```
I turned down a $500K job offer.

Here's why it was the best decision I ever made:
```

**4. The Curiosity Gap**
```
[Question or statement that creates burning curiosity]
```
Example:
```
The CEO pulled me aside after my presentation.

What she said changed everything.
```

**5. The List Promise**
```
[Number] [things/lessons/tips] that [transformed/changed/taught] [me/outcome]

(#[X] changed everything)
```
Example:
```
7 lessons from building a $10M business

(#4 took me 5 years to learn)
```

**6. The Counterintuitive**
```
[Common belief] is wrong.

The truth is [opposite/nuanced view].
```
Example:
```
"Follow your passion" is terrible career advice.

Here's what actually works:
```

**7. The Story Hook**
```
[Year/Time], I was [situation].

[Emotion/state].

Then [turning point]:
```
Example:
```
2019, I was $50,000 in debt.

Broken. Desperate.

Then my mentor told me one thing:
```

**8. The Data Hook**
```
[Surprising statistic]

Let that sink in.
```
Example:
```
73% of employees are job searching right now.

Let that sink in, leaders.
```

## The Body (Core Content)

### Formatting Rules for Readability

**1. One idea per line**
```
❌ Don't write long paragraphs that are hard to scan on mobile. Most LinkedIn users are on their phones and will skip walls of text.

✅ One idea per line.

Short sentences.

White space is your friend.

Mobile-first formatting.
```

**2. Use line breaks strategically**
```
Every 1-2 sentences.

↳ Arrows for sub-points
→ Or this style
• Bullets sparingly

Create rhythm.
```

**3. The "Billboard Test"**
```
If someone can't understand your post
in 3 seconds of scanning...

They won't read it.

Make every line standalone.
```

### Content Structures That Work

**The Story Arc**
```
1. Hook (the moment/problem)
2. Context (background)
3. Conflict (what went wrong)
4. Turning point (the insight)
5. Resolution (what changed)
6. Lesson (takeaway for reader)
7. CTA (engagement prompt)
```

**The Listicle**
```
1. Hook with number promise
2. Brief context (1-2 lines)
3. List items (3-7 optimal)
   - Each item: Bold point + explanation
4. Wrap-up insight
5. CTA
```

**The Framework**
```
1. Name the framework
2. Explain the problem it solves
3. Break down each component
4. Give an example
5. Show the result
6. CTA to save/share
```

**The Contrarian Take**
```
1. State the popular belief
2. Challenge it directly
3. Provide evidence/experience
4. Offer alternative view
5. Acknowledge nuance
6. CTA for debate
```

5. Don't edit the post for 10+ hours
