## CTA Optimization Tips

### Specificity Wins
```
❌ "Comment below"
✅ "Comment with your biggest challenge in [specific area]"

❌ "Share this"
✅ "Tag a founder who needs to hear this"

❌ "Let me know"
✅ "Reply with your [specific thing]"
```

### Make It Easy
```
❌ "Fill out the form on my website"
✅ "Comment 'guide' and I'll DM you"

❌ "Check out my latest blog post"
✅ "Link in first comment. Takes 3 minutes to read."

❌ "Schedule a call if interested"
✅ "DM me 'talk' and I'll send my calendar link"
```

### The "Keyword" Trick
```
Why "DM me '[keyword]'" works:

1. Lower barrier than explaining what they want
2. Easy for you to filter/identify leads
3. Creates micro-commitment
4. Fun/memorable

Examples:
- DM me "blueprint" for the free guide
- Comment "framework" for the template
- Reply "podcast" and I'll share the episode
```

### Stacking CTAs
```
Offer multiple ways to engage:

Primary CTA: [Engagement goal]
Secondary CTA: [Growth goal]
Tertiary CTA: [Lead generation goal]

Example:
"What would you add to this list? 👇
(And follow for more leadership content.
DM me 'toolkit' for my free resource.)"
```

Goal: Engagement, follows, shares

```

```
