First line: [Context that deepens curiosity]

Example:
Hook: "I got fired yesterday."
First line: "Best thing that ever happened to me."
```

Generic: "I made [amount] doing [thing]"
Personalized: "I made $127,000 from LinkedIn posts in 2024"

Generic: "[X] things about [topic]"
Personalized: "7 hiring mistakes I made (that cost me $400K)"
```

### Testing Hooks
```
Before posting, ask:
1. Would this stop MY scroll?
2. Does it create a genuine "I need to know more" feeling?
3. Is it authentic to my voice and experience?
4. Does it deliver on the promise in the post?

## Hooks to Avoid

### Clickbait Red Flags
```
❌ "You won't BELIEVE what happened..."
❌ "This will BLOW YOUR MIND..."
❌ "One WEIRD trick..."
❌ "What happened next will SHOCK you..."
❌ All caps excitement: "AMAZING NEWS!!!"
```

### Why They Fail
```
1. LinkedIn audience is sophisticated
2. Clickbait signals low-value content
3. Even if they click, they'll unfollow
4. Damages trust over time
5. Algorithm penalizes low-quality engagement
```

### The Better Approach
```
Be specific, not sensational:

❌ "This AMAZING strategy will BLOW YOUR MIND"
✅ "This strategy added $47K to our revenue last quarter"

❌ "You won't BELIEVE what my client achieved"
✅ "My client went from 0 to 50K followers in 6 months. Here's how."
```
