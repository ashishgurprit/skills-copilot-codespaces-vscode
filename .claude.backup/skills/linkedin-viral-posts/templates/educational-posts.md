## Educational Content Best Practices

### The Value Test
```
Before posting, ask:
1. Would someone screenshot this?
2. Would someone save this?
3. Would someone share this with a colleague?
4. Does this solve a real problem?

If not, revise until yes.
```

### Making Complex Simple
```
Expert trap: Assuming knowledge
Solution: Write for someone 2 years behind you

❌ "Leverage synergistic paradigm shifts"
✅ "Work with others to find new approaches"

❌ "Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline"
✅ "Automatically test and deploy your code changes"
```

### The Specific Beats Generic Rule
```
❌ "Use good tools"
✅ "Use Notion for docs, Slack for chat, Loom for updates"

❌ "Post at good times"
✅ "Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM in your audience's timezone"

❌ "Write better content"
✅ "Hook in first 2 lines, one idea per line, end with question"
```

### Format for Scanning
```
People don't read, they scan.

Make your posts scannable:
• Bold key words/phrases
• Use symbols (↳ → • ✅ ❌)
• Numbers for lists
• Short lines
• White space
• Clear hierarchy
```

### Credibility Without Bragging
```
❌ "As a 10x revenue growth expert..."
✅ "After helping 50+ companies increase revenue..."

❌ "I'm the best at this"
✅ "Here's what's worked for me and my clients"

❌ "Everyone should do this"
✅ "This approach has worked well for [specific context]"
```
