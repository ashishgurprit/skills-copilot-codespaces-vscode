## The Golden Rule of LinkedIn Promotion

```
90% value, 10% promotion.

Never promote without first establishing value.

These templates wrap promotion in genuine value.

## Promotional Best Practices

### The Promotion Ratio

```
For every 1 promotional post:
• 9 value-giving posts
• Or wait at least 2 weeks between promotions

Your audience will forgive promotion
if you consistently deliver value.
```

### Soft vs Hard CTAs

```
Soft CTAs (preferred for LinkedIn):
• "DM me [keyword] for more info"
• "Comment [word] if you want the link"
• "Check out the link in comments"
• "Curious? Let's connect"

Hard CTAs (use sparingly):
• "Buy now"
• "Sign up today"
• "Don't miss out"
• "Limited time"
```

### Where to Put Links

```
Option 1: First comment (most common)
↳ Add link immediately after posting
↳ Slightly lower reach than link-free
↳ But allows for clickable link

Option 2: In the post (lowest reach)
↳ LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with links
↳ Only for truly high-value destinations

Option 3: Tell them to DM for link
↳ Highest reach
↳ Creates personal connection
↳ More effort to follow up

Option 4: "Link in profile"
↳ Sends traffic to your profile
↳ Feature section should have the link
```

### Making Promotion Feel Natural

```
✅ Do:
• Lead with value/story
• Show genuine results
• Be transparent about what you're promoting
• Acknowledge it's promotional (people respect honesty)
• Make the CTA optional/low pressure

❌ Don't:
• Start with the pitch
• Use fake scarcity
• Over-hype
• Spam the same promotion
• Make it all about you/your product
```

### Testimonial Best Practices

```
✅ Strong testimonials:
• Specific results with numbers
• Named person/company (with permission)
• Addresses a specific problem
• Feels authentic (not polished PR)

❌ Weak testimonials:
• "Great product!"
• Anonymous quotes
• Vague benefits
• Overly polished language
```

### The "Problem First" Approach

```
Structure promotions like this:

1. The Problem (that your audience has)
2. The Pain (why it matters)
3. The Solution (introduced naturally)
4. The Proof (results/testimonials)
5. The CTA (soft, optional)

Never start with your product.
Start with their problem.
```
