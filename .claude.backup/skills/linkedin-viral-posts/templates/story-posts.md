## Writing Tips for Story Posts

### Make It Specific
```
❌ "I had a tough time"
✅ "I was $47,000 in debt, eating ramen for the third week straight"

❌ "Things improved"
✅ "Revenue jumped 340% in 6 months"

❌ "Someone told me something helpful"
✅ "My mentor looked me dead in the eyes and said..."
```

### Show Vulnerability (But Not Trauma Dumping)
```
✅ Appropriate vulnerability:
- Failures and what you learned
- Fears you overcame
- Doubts you worked through
- Mistakes you made

❌ Too much:
- Deep trauma without resolution
- Current mental health crises
- Attacks on specific people
- Oversharing private details
```

### The Emotion Arc
```
Stories that work follow this emotional journey:

1. Tension/Problem → Reader feels understood
2. Struggle → Reader sees themselves
3. Insight/Shift → Reader gets curious
4. Resolution → Reader feels hopeful
5. Lesson → Reader gets actionable value
```

### Length Guidelines
```
Short story (higher engagement): 150-300 words
Medium story (balanced): 300-500 words
Long story (highly engaged audience): 500-800 words

Rule: If every line doesn't add value, cut it.
```
