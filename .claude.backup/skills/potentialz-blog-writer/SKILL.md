## Step 1: Research Phase

### Source Requirements

**Primary Sources (Required)**:
- PubMed/MEDLINE for clinical research

**Source Verification**:
- Prefer studies from last 5 years (update older knowledge)
- Minimum 3-5 peer-reviewed sources per article
- Australian studies preferred when available
- Check for AHPRA/APS alignment

### AHPRA Compliance Checklist

Before writing, verify content will:

- [ ] NOT make unsubstantiated therapeutic claims
- [ ] NOT guarantee outcomes or cure rates
- [ ] NOT use testimonials that imply guaranteed results
- [ ] Include appropriate disclaimers
- [ ] Use evidence-based language ("research suggests", "studies indicate")
- [ ] Avoid sensationalism about mental health conditions
- [ ] Respect patient privacy and confidentiality principles
- [ ] Not discourage seeking professional help
- [ ] Include crisis resources where appropriate

### AHPRA-Compliant Language

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "We cure anxiety" | "Evidence-based treatment can help manage anxiety symptoms" |
| "100% success rate" | "Research shows significant improvement in many cases" |
| "Best psychologist" | "Experienced, registered psychologist" |
| "Guaranteed results" | "Treatment tailored to individual needs" |
| "Revolutionary treatment" | "Evidence-based approach" |

## Step 2: Writing Guidelines

### Year 8 Reading Level Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Maximum sentence length: 25 words
- One idea per sentence

- Define all clinical terms on first use
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
