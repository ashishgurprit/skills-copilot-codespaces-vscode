# AHPRA Advertising Guidelines for Psychology Content

## Overview

The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) regulates advertising by registered health practitioners. All content for Potentialz Unlimited must comply with these guidelines.

## Key Principles

### 1. Truthful and Not Misleading

Content must:
- Be factually accurate and verifiable
- Not create unrealistic expectations
- Not omit important information
- Present balanced information about treatments

### 2. Evidence-Based Claims Only

**Acceptable**:
- "Research suggests CBT can help reduce anxiety symptoms"
- "Studies show EMDR may be effective for trauma"
- "Evidence indicates therapy can support recovery"

**Not Acceptable**:
- "CBT cures anxiety"
- "We guarantee results"
- "The best treatment for depression"
- "100% success rate"

### 3. No Testimonials That Imply Guaranteed Outcomes

**Acceptable**:
- General statements about services offered
- Factual information about qualifications
- Evidence-based treatment descriptions

**Not Acceptable**:
- "Client X was cured after 3 sessions"
- Before/after claims without evidence
- Implied guarantees through success stories

### 4. Qualifications Must Be Verifiable

- Only claim credentials that are current and verifiable
- Use correct professional titles
- Mention AHPRA registration appropriately

## Language Guidelines

### Use Evidence-Based Language

| Instead Of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Cure | Help manage, support recovery |
| Fix | Address, work through |
| Guaranteed | Evidence-based, research-supported |
| Best | Experienced, qualified, registered |
| Breakthrough | Evidence-based, established |
| Revolutionary | Effective, proven approach |
| Always works | Often effective, may help |
| Never fails | High success rates in research |

### Hedging Phrases (Required)

When discussing outcomes, use:
- "Research suggests..."
- "Studies indicate..."
- "Many people find..."
- "Evidence shows that..."
- "Treatment may help..."
- "Can support..."
- "Often effective for..."

### Avoid Absolute Claims

| Avoid | Alternative |
|-------|-------------|
| "Will cure your anxiety" | "Can help you manage anxiety symptoms" |
| "Eliminates depression" | "Supports recovery from depression" |
| "Works for everyone" | "Effective for many people" |
| "Permanent solution" | "Long-term benefits" |
